# Whitelisting Objects

Let's say, you got banned for the reason "<strong>Blacklisted Object Detected</strong>". This ban probably triggers because you was using a object or model that is not whitelisted. To whitelist the object it's very easy. Just add the object to the whitelisting list.

You only need to add network related objects. (Objects that people can see, that got spawned)<br/>
The website provided [here](https://gtahash.ru) is a public list of GTA Hashes

:::note
You can add the object model hash code or the model string.
:::

We're suggesting to <strong>not disable</strong> the object whitelist. Take your time to go through the list and whitelist the objects that you need.

:::tip
You can search through your server for the native CreateObject or CreateObjectNoOffset to see which ones are spawned in your server.
