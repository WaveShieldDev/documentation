# Whitelisting Objects

Got banned for **"Blacklisted Object Detected"**?  
This happens because the object model isn't whitelisted. To fix this, simply add the object to the whitelist.

You only need to add **networked objects**â€”those that everyone can see when spawned.

You can add the object **model hash** or the **model string**.

The website provided [here](https://gtahash.ru) is a public list of GTA Hashes.

:::note
You can add the object model hash code or the model string.
:::
:::warning
ðŸš¨ **We do not recommend disabling the object whitelist.** Take the time to whitelist every networked object that you spawn in your server.
:::
:::tip
You can search through your server for the native `CreateObject` or `CreateObjectNoOffset` to see which ones are spawned in your server.
