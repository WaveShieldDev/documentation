We've developed a very simple, fast, and efficient installation process that requires minimal effort so that you can benefit from all the features of this anti-cheat.

We've provided a **2-minute tutorial** explaining how to install WaveShield perfectly. If you don't understand anything, don't hesitate to contact our support team.

:::caution[Common Problems Encountered]
- ❌ You **can't rename the script**; it must be called **"WaveShield"**.
- 🚀 You need to **start the WaveShield resource first** in your `server.cfg`, before any of your other resources.
- 📂 Place the **WaveShield folder** in `/resources` and **not in a subfolder**.
