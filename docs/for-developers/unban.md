# Unban

There are two ways to unban someone from WaveShield:

## Through the server console (or txAdmin)

```sh
waveshield unban all
waveshield unban <banId> <optional:reason>
```

## Through the in-game chat (or F8 console)

```sh
waveshield unban <banId> <optional:reason>
```

:::caution
`waveshield unban all` unbans every banned player, and there is no way to cancel this action. Please be careful!
