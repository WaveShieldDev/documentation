# Script is not working

First we need to make sure your script is started first and in the correct way in your server.cfg

Refers to this link:
https://ayznnn.gitbook.io/waveshield-v4/troubleshooting/common-issues/black-screen-infinite-awaiting-scripts-errors-after-installing-waveshield

If the script is not starting and only if the script is not starting, you can try to ignore it in the config, note that it will cause issues if you ignore it for any other reasons.

If the script is starting and throwing errors after WaveShield is installed, you can try to ignore it in the config, note that it will cause issues if you ignore it for any other reasons. You also need to report this bug so it get fixed asap. (WaveShield is already working with 99.99% of the scripts so this shouldn't happen/this is probably not your issue)

If the script is starting and not throwing errors, the issue is probably not from WaveShield.
