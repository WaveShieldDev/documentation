# vMenu

vMenu is made in C#, that means WaveShield won't be able to legitimate actions performed from this menu, so you will need to disable on the anti-cheat configuration the features you use on vMenu.

:::warning
Make sure your vMenu resource is named `vMenu` so WaveShield knows you are using it and can make few tweaks.
